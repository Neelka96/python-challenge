    "\n",
    "#### You will be given a financial dataset called **budget_data.csv**. The dataset is composed of two columns: **\"Date\" and \"Profit/Losses\"**.\n",
    "#### Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The total number of months included in the dataset\n",
    "##### The net total amount of \"Profit/Losses\" over the entire period\n",
    "##### The changes in \"Profit/Losses\" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes\n",
    "##### The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period\n",
    "##### The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.\n",
